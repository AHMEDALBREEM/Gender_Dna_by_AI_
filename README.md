# DNA Sequence Processing 

## Description
its right now depening on data and the input is applied on the data of dna.fasta (you can find dataset free online and make sure to clean it also do some search and improve the code condition and certina always (^0^))

This project processes DNA sequences from FASTA files, converting them to RNA and then to protein sequences. It also checks for genetic variants and retrieves gene information from NCBI.

## improvment 
You can also apply this concept to any expected DNA sequences. As you know, DNA often contains common sequences, and these common sequences can help us identify and address potential issues. By analyzing these sequences, we can prevent future problems by creating early interventions, such as targeted treatments or preventive measures for the patient. If complete prevention is not possible, we can at least minimize the impact to ensure it remains unnoticeable, which is a better outcome than allowing the issue to manifest fully.


## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script, execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```

## Example
Make sure to have a valid FASTA file in the specified path.
